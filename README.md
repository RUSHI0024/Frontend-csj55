# Crush_02

This project is dedicated to crush.  
I wanted to show her something I created, but it was a little challenging for me.  

CHALLENGES>>>
- I didn’t want to put my name in the project.  
- I planned to deploy this website in our college lab using her login.  
- Our college didn’t have internet access, so I had to make sure it worked offline.  

To solve this, I wrote a **basic website** and added **AI-inspired features** to make it more attractive.  
Everything was designed to run without internet, so it could still feel special and interactive.
